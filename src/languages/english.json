    "information": "A habit is a repetitive behavior or routine that you perform almost automatically, often without consciously thinking about it. Habits can be both positive and negative, shaping our daily lives and long-term outcomes. It's often said that it takes around 21 to 66 days of consistent practice to turn an activity into a habit, though the exact timeframe can vary from person to person. Tracking your habits can help you become more aware of your actions and work towards the goal of making them a natural part of your daily life for a healthier and more productive lifestyle.",
